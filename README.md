mender-convert
==============

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains mender-convert, which is used to convert pre-built disk images (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, etc) to a Mender compatible
image by restructuring partition table and injecting the necessary files.

Currently official Raspberry Pi 3 and BeagleBone Black images are supported and this will be extended.

## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).


## Docker environment for mender-convert

In order to correctly set up partitions and bootloaders, mender-convert has many dependencies,
and their version and name vary between Linux distributions.

To make using mender-convert easier, a reference setup using a Ubuntu 18.04 Docker container
is provided.

You need to [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install) to use this environment.


### Build the mender-convert container image

To build a container based on Ubuntu 18.04 with all required dependencies for mender-convert,
copy this directory to your workstation and change the current directory to it.

Then run

```bash
./docker-build
```

This will create a container image you can use to run mender-convert.


### Use the mender-convert container image

Create a directory `input` under the directory where you copied these files (`docker-build`, `docker-mender-convert`, etc.):

```bash
mkdir input
```

Then put your raw disk image into `input/`, e.g.

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img input/2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img
```

You can run mender-convert from inside the container with your desired options, e.g.


```bash
DEVICE_TYPE="raspberrypi3"
RAW_DISK_IMAGE="input/2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img"

ARTIFACT_NAME="2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch"
MENDER_DISK_IMAGE="2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.sdimg"
TENANT_TOKEN="<INSERT-TOKEN-FROM Hosted Mender>"

./docker-mender-convert from-raw-disk-image                      \
            --raw-disk-image $RAW_DISK_IMAGE                     \
            --mender-disk-image $MENDER_DISK_IMAGE               \
            --device-type $DEVICE_TYPE                           \
            --artifact-name $ARTIFACT_NAME                       \
            --bootloader-toolchain arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf \
            --server-url "https://hosted.mender.io"              \
            --tenant-token $TENANT_TOKEN
```

By default conversion in containter uses GCC 7.3.0 bootlin toolchain tuned for
ARMv6 architecture (especially for ARM1176(F)-S single-core processor).
The aim of that is to provide a support for the Raspberry Pi Zero W development board.

ARMv7 is backward compatible with ARMv6, so binaries compiled for ARMv6 should also work on ARMv7.

Note that the default Mender client is the latest stable and cross-compiled for generic ARM boards,
which should work well in most cases. If you would like to use a different Mender client,
place it in `input/` and adjust the `--mender-client` argument.

Conversion will take 10-15 minutes, depending on your storage and resources available.
You can watch `output/build.log` for progress and diagnostics information.

After it finishes, you can find your images in the `output` directory on your host machine!


### Customizing the image
`mender-convert` allows custom files to be added to the image after all processing has taken place but before the artifact is created. This is done using the following command line options:
* `--rootfs-overlay`: Add files to the rootfs partition.
* `--boot-overlay`: Add files to the boot partition.
* `--data-overlay`: Add files to the data partition.

To use this feature, create a new directory under the directory where you copied these files and place the files to be copied inside, making sure that the directory structure and permissions are how they should be on the target file system. Then, pass the directory path to `mender-convert` using one of the above command line options.

E.g. With the following file structure created for a rootfs overlay:

```
rootfs/
├── [drwxr-xr-x pi     ]  etc
│   └── [-rw------- root    ]  testfile
└── [drwxr-xr-x pi     ]  home
    └── [drwxr-xr-x pi     ]  pi
        ├── [-rw-r--r-- pi     ]  file1
        ├── [-rw-r--r-- pi     ]  file2
        └── [-rw-r--r-- pi     ]  file3
```
and `mender-convert` called with the following additional option:

```
mender-convert ..... --rootfs-overlay rootfs/
```

...the contents of the `rootfs` folder would be copied as-is to the root directory of the rootfs partition, resulting in `testfile` present under `/etc/` and `file1 file2 file3` under `/home/pi/`, with all the file attributes preserved.


### Known issues
* An issue for `Raspberry Pi Zero W` has been spotted with the `mender-convert` tool version 1.1.0.
  After an initial boot, having last partition resized to the end of the SD card, the correct device
  tree cannot be found. As a result the boot cannot succeed.
  For more information and current status, see [issue tracker](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2436).
* If building U-boot fails with:
```
     D	scripts/Kconfig
     input in flex scanner failed
     ....
     include/linux/kconfig.h:4:32: fatal error: generated/autoconf.h: No such file or directory
     #include <generated/autoconf.h>
```
you might be using a case-sensitive filesystem which is not supported. Case-sensitive filesystems are typically used on OSX (Mac) and Windows but you can also run in to this on Linux if running on a NTFS formatted partition.
